Just a simple n-body simulation I threw together in a few hours.

Blue and Red particles are able to have different "charges," though this needs to be hardcoded.

The simulation is 3D, and there is a rotation rate for the camera, also hardcoded.
I may add some keyboard controls later for rotation, I just didn't have much of a need to when I was throwing this code together.
